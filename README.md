### Sarcasm vs. Satire 


This is an effort to separate `Sarcasm`_ from _`Satire`_ from English languate sentences.As is well known they differ in their connotation,
one is said to be more brazen and blatant in comparison to the other. Separating the two,by putting them together in a classification
problem seems to be an interesting problem for various reasons. 
Techniques such as `Embedding` wouldn't go very far as both sarcasm and satire have a certain amount of wordplay which tend
to give same workd different meaning based on their relative usage in a text.

This is an effor to solve the problem in a generalised manner so that it generalizes to english language texts having class ratios
of different order along with sentence s of various lenghts. 

I am hoping this leads to a open source contribution in the form of some kind of API.
