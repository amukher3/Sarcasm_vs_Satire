### Sarcasm vs. Satire 


This is an effort to separate the fine line between  _`Sarcasm`_ and  _`Satire`_ in English language sentences.As is well known they differ mostly in their connotation , one is said to be more brazen and blatant in comparison to the other. Separating the two,by putting them together in a classification problem seems to be an interesting problem for various reasons.

The 'go-to' techniques such as `Embedding` wouldn't go very far as both sarcasm and satire have a certain amount of wordplay which tend
to give the same word different meaning based on their relative usage in a text.

This is an effor to solve the problem in a generalised manner so that it generalizes to any english language text, having class ratios
of any order with sentences of various lenghts. 

This is still 'work in progress' with a test-set accuracy of around 0.7 in a medium sized corpus. I am hoping, in future this might lead to a open source contribution in the form of some kind of API.
